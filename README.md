# Minimal-HUD (Redesigned)

This project is a redesigned version of the original **[minimal-hud](https://github.com/ThatMadCap/minimal-hud)** by [ThatMadCap](https://github.com/ThatMadCap).
All credit for the original concept and base work goes to them.

I‚Äôve reworked the HUD to fit my own style and preferences, with a focus on a cleaner presentation and easy customization. This release is my personal redesign while remaining respectful to the original project.
