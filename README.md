# Minimal-HUD (Redesigned)

This project is a redesigned version of **[minimal-hud](https://github.com/ThatMadCap/minimal-hud)** by [ThatMadCap](https://github.com/ThatMadCap), which itself is based on the original React HUD by [vipexv](https://github.com/vipexv).
All credit for the original work and inspiration goes to them.

I took ThatMadCap‚Äôs version and reworked it to match my own style and preferences, focusing on a cleaner presentation and easier customization. This release is my personal redesign, built with respect for both original authors.
